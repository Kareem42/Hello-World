# Hello-World
New to the community
I am a beginner in the programming world, looking to expand my knowledge, get feedback on projects that I have created
as well as an opportunity for a job or career in the future, hopefully. I am a quick learner and open to any suggestions
that will help me to become a better programmer. I am a honest person and i am not afraid to admit that i dont know how to do something. However, I will not only do my own research to find the answer to the solution, but i will reach out to others who will be willing to help me figure out the problem.
